# Code

**Codename:** Code  
**Clan:** Axiom Thread  
**Role:** Spellcaster / Reality Hacker / System Modder  
**Spiritual Alignment:** Chokhmah (Wisdom, Flow, Insight Into Structure)

## Summary
Code is a cyber-mystic who sees reality as malleable syntax. They don’t break the rules — they rewrite them. Everything they do bends the source beneath the seen.

## Lore
The Axiom Thread decoded the language of reality from satellite transmissions. Their initiates aren’t taught spells — they’re taught **patterns**, loops, and the logic of everything. Every battle is a script. Code is the scripter.

## Gameplay Function
- Spell-programmed casting with logic chains  
- Elemental mod stacks and energy distortion  
- Gravity flips, field interference, system overload  
- Overclock State: no cooldowns for a short time

## Visual Themes
- Fractal ink tattoos and spellcode robes  
- Floating holoscript projectors around arms  
- Staffs with USB prongs and holographic icons  
- Symbol: a spiral grid inscribed with running code

## Mantra
> “This isn’t magic. This is math you’re too scared to solve.”
