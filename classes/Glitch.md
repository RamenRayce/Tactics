# Glitch

**Codename:** Glitch  
**Clan:** Echo Sleep  
**Role:** Dreamwalker / Fate Breaker / Timeline Distorter  
**Spiritual Alignment:** Da’at (Hidden Knowledge, Broken Awareness, Unwritten Paths)

## Summary
Glitch walks through possibilities. Their power is unchosen memory, corrupted vision, premonition as weapon. Reality bends around them not because they will it — but because they’ve already **seen** it.

## Lore
Echo Sleep is a fractured digital dream where failed AI and dreamers fuse. Those who awaken in its layers come back... different. Glitch remembers lives they never lived. They rewrite what was supposed to happen.

## Gameplay Function
- Timeline rewind (for self or ally)  
- Dreamzone AoE with unstable effects  
- Prophetic debuffs and fate-bending status  
- Collapse trigger: enemies caught in multiple effects take heavy damage

## Visual Themes
- Robes woven from animated static  
- Symbols shift randomly across their face  
- Dream talismans flicker with otherworld patterns  
- Symbol: a broken eye above a sideways clock

## Mantra
> “I’ve already seen this moment. We die. But not today.”
