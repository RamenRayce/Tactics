# Null

**Codename:** Null  
**Clan:** Hollow Sigil  
**Role:** Infiltrator / Data Eraser / Stealth Hacker  
**Spiritual Alignment:** Hod (Glory, Secret Knowledge, Strategic Silence)

## Summary
Null is a shadow encoded into the world’s broken systems — a figure who strikes not to be seen, but to *not be remembered*. They delete presence, manipulate access, and erase data... including you.

## Lore
Nulls are chosen, not trained — selected by the Hollow Sigil when their digital presence falls to zero. Their belief: if something is truly forgotten, it can be *freed*.

## Gameplay Function
- Silent kill combos  
- Hack-based cloaking, memory disruption  
- Bypass traps and surveillance  
- Passive: less detectable the longer they stay still

## Visual Themes
- Matte-black cloaks with glitch-reactive scale  
- Sigil mask that distorts light  
- Datablades shaped like anti-icons  
- Icon: a broken mirror that reflects nothing

## Mantra
> “To strike unseen is to let the world believe it healed itself.”
