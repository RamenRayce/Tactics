# Blackline

**Codename:** Blackline  
**Clan:** Gravepath Core  
**Role:** Necrotech Invoker / Death-Code Summoner  
**Spiritual Alignment:** Malkuth (Kingdom, Manifestation, Rebirth Through Death)

## Summary
Blackline doesn't mourn the dead. They download them. Using necro-scripts and corrupted tech, they bind digital ghosts into physical constructs and summon forgotten souls as virus-born allies.

## Lore
The Gravepath Core formed in the ruins of old server tombs. Their purpose: not to remember death, but to **reboot it.** Each wraith they summon is part prayer, part weapon. Their battlefield is a shrine.

## Gameplay Function
- Raise corpse-bots and AI wraiths  
- Siphon death energy to fuel skills  
- Rot fields that corrupt terrain  
- Collapse surges when allies or enemies die

## Visual Themes
- Rusted bone-metal armor laced with pulsing death glyphs  
- Wires like veins, exposed and ritual-bound  
- Floating relics from ancestor-AIs orbit their form  
- Symbol: a stylized skull inside a data-core ring

## Mantra
> “I carry every name that fell. When I strike, they strike with me.”
