# Veil

**Codename:** Veil  
**Clan:** Hollow Daughters  
**Role:** Emotion Witch / Spirit Caster / Hex Weaver  
**Spiritual Alignment:** Binah (Understanding, Emotion, Inner Sorrow as Power)

## Summary
Veil turns emotion into magic. Her spells are echoes of grief and rage woven into sigils and shadow. She’s a sacred wound made spell. Every curse she casts was once a feeling she refused to bury.

## Lore
The Hollow Daughters remember the world’s mourning. They use grief as a language, weaving rites from feeling instead of force. A Veil doesn’t memorize spells — she **relives them**, each one a sacred act.

## Gameplay Function
- Emotion-based magic states (rage, sorrow, joy)  
- Summon spirits tied to feelings  
- Area hex fields and ritual slow zones  
- Ritual surge: cast speed increases with emotion intensity

## Visual Themes
- Veil robes that glitch through memories  
- Tear-glyph tattoos and sigil-wrapped scrolls  
- Spirit familiars swirl as visible echoes  
- Symbol: an open eye with a single falling tear, digitized

## Mantra
> “To cast is to cry, to cry is to know, and to know is to wield.”
