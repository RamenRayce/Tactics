# Mesh

**Codename:** Mesh  
**Clan:** Spindle Halo  
**Role:** Tactical Controller / Drone Summoner / Grid Weaver  
**Spiritual Alignment:** Yesod (Foundation, Structure, Relay of Intent)

## Summary
Mesh doesn’t fight with weapons. They fight with **structure** — drones, data walls, and interference. They’re the planner in a world full of chaos. The reason you’re still alive? Mesh.

## Lore
Spindle Halo is an underground order keeping the remnants of the planet’s grid alive. Mesh users interface with it — building formations, deploying guardians, controlling terrain through structure and rhythm.

## Gameplay Function
- Deployable drone support (combat, heal, buff, scout)  
- Field control via tech beacons and force zones  
- Relay uplinks for ally synergy

## Visual Themes
- Drone ports built into tactical armor  
- Gloves with AR node projection rigs  
- Halo tattoos that light up on full network sync  
- Symbol: a grid with a glowing node at center

## Mantra
> “The plan was already written. I’m just bringing it online.”
